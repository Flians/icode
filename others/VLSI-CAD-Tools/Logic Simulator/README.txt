This is a simple compiled code simulator capable of simulating combinational circuits.
A netlist (txt file) of a specific format is required. Some sample netlists have been provided.

The netlist can contain the following components-
* Inverter
* Buffer
* 2 input OR Gate
* 2 input AND Gate
* 2 input NOR Gate
* 2 input NAND Gate
* 2 input XOR Gate
* 2 input XNOR Gate
* 2x1 Multiplexer

The name of the netlist to be simulated must be changed in the code. No other change is necessary.
The tool will ask to provide input values and will display output values. 
Enter 0 or 1 only for accurate results, any other entry will be treated as X.
